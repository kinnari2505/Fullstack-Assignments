How contactus page works

Validation 

Name: cannot be empty
Email: regex check for proper format
Message: must be at least 10 characters


Local Storage stores an array of contact objects in JSON format.
Display function reads from Local Storage and shows the stored contacts dynamically.
Works even after refresh since Local Storage persists in the browser.

//document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
    above line is telling the browser that 
   "Run the code inside this function only after the HTML document has been fully
    loaded and parsed, but before images, CSS, and other external resources have 
    finished loading."

});

Why it’s used
If you try to access elements in JavaScript before they exist in the DOM, you’ll get null errors.
By wrapping your script in DOMContentLoaded, you ensure the HTML structure is ready to work with.

document → Refers to the current webpage’s DOM (Document Object Model).
.addEventListener() → Listens for an event to happen.
"DOMContentLoaded" → A special event that fires when the HTML is fully loaded and turned into the DOM tree.
() => { ... } → An arrow function that will execute when the event happens.


What it does
form.addEventListener("submit", ...)

This means "When the form is submitted (by clicking a submit button or pressing Enter), 
run the function inside."

(e)
This is the event object automatically passed to your function.
It contains details about the event (what triggered it, when, where, etc.).

e.preventDefault()

By default, submitting a form causes the browser to Send the form data to the server 
(if action is set)
Reload or navigate away from the current page

preventDefault() stops this default behavior.
This is useful when you want to handle the form entirely with JavaScript 
(e.g., validation, saving to local storage, AJAX).
